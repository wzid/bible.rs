(25) whom God sent to be an atoning sacrifice, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness through the passing over of prior sins, in Godâ€™s forbearance;
(26) to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time; that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus.
(27) Where then is the boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith.
```


## **TODO**
- Add [`clap_complete`](https://docs.rs/clap_complete/latest/clap_complete/) crate for auto-completion in the terminal
- Switch between translations
